## Genome Informatics Project

Implement the algorithm for indexed searching of strings in a given text using Burrows-Wheeler transformation and FM index in python. 
The initial version of the algorithm should be implemented in a traditional way as described in the lecture, without memory and execution time optimizations.
Write tests for each function in the code, as well as for the final algorithm. 
Optimize the code in terms of memory usage and execution time. Run the previously defined tests and verify that all of them still pass (regression testing). 
Measure the improvement in memory usage and execution time using 3 sets of test data: 
- Text: Coffea arabica, Chromosome 1c and patterns: ATGCATG, TCTCTCTA, TTCACTACTCTCA 
- Text: Mus pahari chromosome X, and patterns: ATGATG, CTCTCTA, TCACTACTCTCA 
- Genome of choice from the NIH database and three arbitrary patterns of different lengths. 

Prepare a presentation (Google Slides or PowerPoint) of the initial and optimized algorithms, as well as the results themselves.
Prepare a video presentation of the project (3 - 5 minutes in duration) which will be available on YouTube or another online video service.
